# Satellite Image Segmentation Using U-Net

## 🌍 Overview
This project implements a deep learning model using the *U-Net architecture* for pixel-level segmentation of satellite images. The goal is to accurately identify and classify terrain features such as land, water, and vegetation — enabling automated geospatial analysis for satellite missions and Earth observation.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Utilizes *TensorFlow* and *Keras* for training and inference.  
- Processes high-resolution *remote sensing datasets* for segmentation.  
- Performs *semantic segmentation* using the *U-Net* architecture.  
- Designed for applications in *land cover mapping, **urban planning, and **disaster monitoring*.  

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- Satellite imagery datasets (e.g., DeepGlobe, SpaceNet)

## 🚀 Results
Achieved high-accuracy segmentation on sample satellite datasets with efficient model performance, demonstrating the potential of AI in automating geospatial data interpretation.

## 🛰 About
Developed as part of an AI-based space analytics project focusing on integrating *machine learning with satellite image processing* for intelligent Earth observation.
